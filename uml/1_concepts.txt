Lesson 1 ---- OO Concepts

1) Classes and Objects
----------------------
A class is an abstract data type that contains a set of attributes and methods (or functions).

An object is an instance of a class.

All objects share the same copy of the member functions but maintain a separate copy of the member data.

Consider the analogy of Cars. Cars like Ferrari, BMW and Chevrolet share certain similar features and can be grouped
together to form objects of the class Cars.
