Lesson 1 ---- OO Concepts

1) Classes and Objects
----------------------
A class is an abstract data type that contains a set of attributes and methods (or functions).

An object is an instance of a class.

All objects share the same copy of the member functions but maintain a separate copy of the member data.

Consider the analogy of Cars. Cars like Ferrari, BMW and Chevrolet share certain similar features and can be grouped
together to form objects of the class Cars.

Refer to the file class_objects.png  in this folder to understand the above concept.

2) Inheritance
-------------------
This refers to sharing of attributes and behaviours among classes based upon hierarchical relationship.
The inheritance concept allows us to define a new class by extending an existing class.
The original class is called a base class or super class.
The new class obtained through inheritance is called a derived class or a sub class. A base class is a generalisation
of the derived class, which means that the base class contains only those properties that are common to all the derived classes.

Consider an example.
Motorcycles,autorickshaws,cars and trucks have certain properties in common. They all have wheels,engines and horns.
There they can be grouped under a super class called automobiles. Apart from sharing these common features,each sub class has its own
particular characteristics such as trucks run on diesel, autorickshaws run on CNG while cars may run on petrol or diesel.

Inheritance benefits:---

Inheritance of classes allows for reuse of code.
If certain data or methods are similar in a set of classes, then instead of defining those methods and data in each class separately,
we can define the common methods and data in the base class. The derived class can then inherit the common methods
and attributes from the base class.
