# CORE JAVA LEARNING GUIDE

Hello readers!! This is an attempt to share my learnings of Core Java over the years in a fun textbook available on GITBOOK.
I have used JDK 18 (JDK - Java Development Kit) which is the latest version available at the time of writing this book.

I am not going to cover all the libraries available in the gargantuan world of Java. This language is a behemoth and 
frankly speaking, I have just used a bucket of water from this ocean. 

We will also learn Object-oriented programming which forms the bedrock of Java programming. Java treats everything as an object!
Java continues to grow and expand. I laughed when just a few years ago, there was a growing population of software naysayers
who were quick to write the obituary of Java. Java has silenced all its critics and will continue to do so in the years to come.

I will be using Java Standard Edition (Java SE) 18 for the code. The code snippets and this book is free to use!!
