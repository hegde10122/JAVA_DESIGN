### What is UML ?

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is one of the most useful tools in the
world of system development. It is a visual modeling language that allows
system builders to create blueprints that capture their visions in a standard, easy-to-understand manner, 
and provides a mechanism to effectively share and communicate these  visions with others.

The UML consists of a number of graphical elements that combine to form diagrams. Because
the UML is a language, it has rules for combining these elements. 

### Class Diagram

We have many things around us in our daily surroundings. These things have properties (attributes) and behave in certain 
ways. These behaviours are a set of operations. These things fall into a set of categories like buildings, shops, 
vehicles,gadgets etc. A class is a category or group of things that have the same attributes and the same behaviours. 

Anything in the class of microwave ovens has attributes such as brand name, model, serial number, and
capacity. Behaviours for things in this class include the operations "accept food,"turn on", and "turn off".

UML class icon
---------------
An example of the UML notation that captures these attributes and behaviours of a microwave oven. 
A rectangle is the icon that represents the class. It's divided into three areas. 
The uppermost area contains the name, the middle area holds the attributes, and the lowest area holds the operations.

Similarly,  we consider class of Washing machines. Both the class diagrams are depicted in the figure below.

Observe the spacing in the names of the class, the attributes, and the operations. In UML, a
multi-word classname has initial capital letters for all the words and eliminates whitespace
between each word (for example, WashingMachine or MicrowaveOven). Attribute-names and operation-names
follow the same convention, but the first letter of the first word isn't capitalized (for example,
acceptFood()).

A class diagram consists of a number of these rectangle icons connected by lines that show how the classes relate to one another.

Object Diagram
---------------

An object is an instance of a class - a definite thing with certain values of the class' attributes. For example, the microwave might have the brand name 
Samsung, the model name Countertop, serial number G134250, capacity of 23L.

See the figure below for an idea about object diagram.
