1) The diagram shows class hierarchy at three different levels.

2) The Employee class is the super class (parent class) of Full Time and Part Time classes.
3) These two classes inherit properties of the Employee class. This is called single inheritance.
4) The Manager and Engineer classes inherit properties from the Full time class displaying single inheritance.
5) The Developer class inherits properties from the Full Time and Part Time classes displaying multiple inheritance.
6) The Employee class is an abstract class as it includes abstract functions such as display(int), addEmployee() and
removeEmployee(). These classes are implemented by the derived classes Full Time and Part Time.
7) The attributes of the Employee class are declared with protected access. This means that the attributes of the
Employee class are accessible to the Full Time and Part Time classes.
8) Full Time and Part Time classes can modify the attributes of the Employees class due to protected access.
9) The attributes basicSalary and otherPerks of the Full Time class have private access. These two attributes therefore, cannot be
accessed directly by its derived classes Manager,Engineer and Developer.
10) Similarly, the attributes fee and timeWorked in the Part Time class cannot be accessed by the derived class Developer due to
their private access.
11) The display(int) method in the Employee class is abstract and each sub class has this method. The implementation of the
display(int) function is provided in the Full Time and Part Time classes. The derived classes Manager and Engineer override the display(int)
function of the Full Time class to display their individual implementations. This represents the polymorphism concept of
object-oriented design.
